# supercrawler
A Simple crawler for tracking down travel related websites

## Note:

1. Install the dependancies
2. Create .env file and add the following VARS.

```
DB_NAME=db_name_here
DB_USER=db_username_here
DB_PASSWORD=db_user_password_here
DB_HOST=db_host
```

4. Run the migration
5. Run the seed
6. Sample URLs are added on the app.js file. Change them as needed. 
7. Enjoy!

I have included a keywords file with around 800 keywords. And also I added a seeder file to insert some locations. 

The script may take time to fetch data from on sub pages of web pages linked with URLs.
